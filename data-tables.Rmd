# Thinking Big: Data Tables {#data-tables}

Data frames are core elements for data handling in R.  However, the
suffer from several limitations.  One of the major issue with data
frames is that they are memory hungry and slow.  This is not an issue
when working with relatively small datasets (say, up to 100,000
rows).  However, when your dataset size exceed gigabytes, dataframes
may be infeasibly slow and too memory hungry.


## Background: Passing By Value And Passing By Reference

R is (mostly) a pass-by-value language.  This means that when you
modify the data, at every step a new copy of the modified object is
created, stored in memory, and the former object is freed
(carbage-collected) if not in use any more.

The main advantage of this approach is consistency: we have a
guarantee that functions do not modify their inputs.



## Data Tables: intro

look like data frames


## Indexing:

[i, j, by]

compare with dplyr


## Create variables by reference

:=

## keys

Sort in advance

fast lookups


## joins, melt
