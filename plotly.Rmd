# Plotly

In this module, you'll start building visualizations using the Plotly API. Plotly is a visualization software that recently open-sourced it's API to JavaScript, MatLab, Python, and R, making it quite valuable to learn. Plotly graphs are fairly customizable, and (by default) have a variety of interactive methods with each chart (i.e., hover, brush to zoom, pan, etc.). Many of these events are fairly cumbersome to build programmatically, which makes a library like Plotly quite attractive.


## Getting Started
The Plotly API is an R package that you'll use to build interactive graphics. Like other open-source that we've used in this course, we'll load this API as a R package as follows:

```bash
# Install package
install.packages("plotly")

# Load library
library(plotly)
```

Then, the `plot_ly` object will be accessible to you to build graphics on your page.

<p>Note: sometimes RStudio fails to show your plotly graph in a website preview when you use `plotly` in an `RMarkdown` documnent. However, if you click on the **Open in Browser** button, you should be able to interact with your chart as it will show in a web browser. This isn't your fault, and doesn't need to be de-bugged.</p>

## Basic Charts
One of the best ways to start building charts with Plotly is to take a look at a [basic example](https://plot.ly/r/#basic-charts) of your choice, and explore the syntax. In general, to build a Plotly object (graph) you'll pass a **dataframe** into the `plot_ly` function, then **adjust the parameters** to specify what you want to visualize. For example, here is the basic example of a scatterplot from the documentation:

```bash
# Make a scatterplot of the iris data
plot_ly(data = iris, x = ~Sepal.Length, y = ~Petal.Length, mode = "markers", type = "scatter")
```

The approach seems pretty straightforward -- in fact, if you exclude `type = "scatter"` and `mode = "markers"`, Plotly will make an educated guess about what type of plot you want (and in this case, it will in fact create a scatterplot!). The only syntax that looks a bit strange is the tilde character (`~`). In R, the tilde designates a variable as a **formula**, which was a design choice of the developers of the API.

## Layout
While the `plot_ly` function controls the data that is being visualized, additional chart options such as _titles and axes_ are controlled by the `layout` function. The `layout` function accepts as a parameter **a plotly object**, and _manipulates that object_. Again, I think a great place to start is an example in the [documentation](https://plot.ly/r/line-and-scatter/):

```r
# From documentation

# Create a plotly object `p`
p <- plot_ly(data = iris, x = ~Sepal.Length, y = ~Petal.Length, type = "scatter", mode = "markers",
        marker = list(size = 10,
                       color = 'rgba(255, 182, 193, .9)',
                       line = list(color = 'rgba(152, 0, 0, .8)',
                                   width = 2))) %>%
  # Use pipe function to pass the plotly object into the `layout` function                           
  layout(title = 'Styled Scatter',
         yaxis = list(zeroline = FALSE),
         xaxis = list(zeroline = FALSE))

# Show chart
p
```
This example uses the pipe operator (`%>%`) to pass the plotly object _into_ the `layout` function as the first argument. We can then infer the structure of the other parameters, which you can read about more in the [API Documentation](https://plot.ly/r/reference/#Layout_and_layout_style_objects):


## Hovers
By default, plotly will provide information on each element when you hover over it (which is **awesome**). To manipulate the information in a hover, you can modify the `text` attribute in the `plot_ly` function, and you can **use your data** to populate the information on hover:

```r
# From documentation

# Create data
d <- diamonds[sample(nrow(diamonds), 1000), ]

# Create plot, specifying hover text
p <- plot_ly(
  d, x = ~carat, y = ~price, mode = "markers", type = "scatter",
  # Hover text:
  text = ~paste0("Price:$", price, '<br>Cut: ', cut),
  color = ~carat, size = ~carat
)

# Show chart
p

```

Note, plotly allows you to specify HTML syntax in the text formula. In this case, it uses a line break `<br>` to improve the layout.
